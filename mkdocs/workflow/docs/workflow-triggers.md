# TACTIC Event System Introduction

The TACTIC Event System is built into the base transactional system in
Tacticâ€™s core. Every transaction which occurs in Tactic can fire an
event which in turn, can be used to execute a trigger or notification.


**Raw Database Events**

Below is the list of the database level events. These events are run
regardless of how they are called (interface, api, external integration
etc)

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>done</strong></th>
<th>Executed each time a transaction completes</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>insert</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Executed each time a Search Object has been inserted.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>update</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Executed each time a Search Object has been updated.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>change</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Executed each time a Search Object has changed. This combines the events insert, update and delete.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>retire</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Executed each time a Search Object has been retired.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>delete</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Executed each time a Search Object has been deleted.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>checkin</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Executed each time a checkin occurs for a Search Object</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>checkout</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Executed each time a checkout occurs for a Search Object</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>timed</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Executed on a timed interval. This is only supported for triggers.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>







For example, in a transaction where the status of a task is being
changed, an association to this event can be made with the following
notation:

    update|sthpw/task|assigned

The notation can consist of 3 sections although only the event is
required.

    <Event>|<SType>|<Column>

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Event</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The raw database event.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>SType</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The Searchable Type (SType) the event is occurring for.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Column</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The Column that was changed in the SType.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
