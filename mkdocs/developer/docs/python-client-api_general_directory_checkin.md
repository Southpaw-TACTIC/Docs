# directory\_checkin

**directory\_checkin(search\_key, context, dir, snapshot\_type="directory", description="No description", file\_type='main', is\_current=True, level\_key=None, metadata={}, mode="copy", is\_revision=False, checkin\_type="strict")**

Check in a directory of files. This informs TACTIC to treat the
entire directory as single entity without regard to the structure
of the contents. TACTIC will not know about the individual files
and the directory hierarchy within the base directory and it it left
up to the and external program to intepret and understand this.

This is often used when logic on the exact file structure exists in
some external source outside of TACTIC and it is deemed too complicated
to map this into TACTICâ€™s snapshot definition.
