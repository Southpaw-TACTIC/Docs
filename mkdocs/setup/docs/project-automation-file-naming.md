# Project Automation - File Naming

![image](media/project-automation_naming.png)

The naming page provides a way of controlling directory and file naming
conventions through a simple expression language . Each naming entry can
contain a directory naming and/or file naming. It is designed that so
that a relatively non-technical user can create custom naming
conventions for various sTypes.

The relative path expression language is a simple language, but in order
to understand it you must know the basic components that generally make
up a naming convention. The expression language allows access to almost
any data in TACTIC. The keywords which are the most relevant in naming
conventions are as follows:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="23%" />
<col width="76%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>parent:</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The parent sObject to the current sObject defined by the search type attribute</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>sObject:</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The actual sObject which is being referenced</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>snapshot:</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The child snapshot generated or being referenced for the naming convention. This contains the context and version information.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>file:</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The file object pertinent to the check-in. This allows for reference to the original file name or extension.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>login:</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The user who is carrying out the check-in or check-out.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>user:</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The user who is carrying out the check-in or check-out.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The properties of these Search Objects are used to build up the naming
convention.

A simple example of a relative path is as follows:

    {project.code}/sequence/{parent.code}/{sobject.code}/{snapshot.context}/maya

which after translation could be translated into:

    sample3d/sequence/XG/XG001/model/maya

This expression is explicit in that every variable scopes the object
that the attribute comes from.

Another example is for a file name:

    {sobject.code}_{snapshot.context}_v{snapshot.version}.{ext}

This can be translated into: `chr001_model_v001.ma` upon expansion.

The @GET(sobejct.code) or @GET(sobject.sthpw/snapshot.version) TACTIC
expression language syntax can be used instead; however, the original
keyword approach is more readable. In case you do decide to use the TEL
syntax, here are the equivalents:

{basefile} = \\{$BASEFILE}

{ext} = \\{$EXT}

\\{project.code} = \\{$PROJECT}

{login} = \\{$LOGIN}

It is important to note that you canâ€™t fix TEL syntax with the keyword
syntax in the same field of a naming entry.

**3.0 Defaults**

TACTIC will fall back on the default convention which would be
represented by the following expression. These defaults are slightly
different from previous versions:

     {project.code}/{search_type}/{sobject.code}/{context}

     {file.name}_{context}_v{version}.{ext}

Checking in the file ***characterFile.ma*** would create the following
file and directory structure:

    sample3d/characters/chr001/publish/characterFile_v001.ma

**Assumptions**

Various assumptions have been made about which attributes are attached
to which SObjects. It is often the case that the context is composed of
a number of parts that are of interest to a naming convention.

For example, it is conceivable to have a context named: "model/hi".
However, you may wish to break this up in a specific way in your naming
convention. This is accomplished using \[\] notation common to many
programming languages.

The following notation could be used for a directory using this: which
could be translated into

     {code}/{context[0]}/maya/{context[1]}

     chr001/model/maya/hi

To insert a naming convention expression, load a **Naming** view and click
the Insert button to insert a new set of expressions.

A Naming Convention sObject has specific properties which are used to
either define the convention or act as conditions to define if the
convention should be used for the given checkin. When Inserting, fill in
the following options:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="26%" />
<col width="73%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Search Type</strong></th>
<th>The search_type to associate the naming convention to.</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Snapshot Type</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The snapshot type of the checkin to use as a condition (default for most TACTIC check-ins is 'file'. Default for directory checkin using the General Checkin Widget is 'dir'. Since this is a more advanced attribute, it is hidden by default)</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Context</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The snapshot context of the checkin to use as a condition (default checkin when there is no pipeline is 'publish')</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Dir Naming</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The expression entry for the directory naming convention</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">

<tr class="odd">

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Latest versionless</strong></p></td>
<td><p>If set to true(checked), every time a check-in is created, a latest version of the main file will be created as well. If you want to always have a file that refers to the latest version of a model you can use this feature by calling it \{sobject.code}_{context}_latest.{ext}. The latest version exists as copy by default. To make it a symlink, set the project setting versionless_mode to 'symlink'. Note: If this is checked, you need to have an entry in the naming table just for this versionless case in addition to the usual one for regular check-ins.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">

<td><p>If set to true(checked), every time a check-in is created, a current version of the main file will be created as well. If you want to always have a file that refers to the latest version of a model you can use this feature by calling it \{sobject.code}_{context}_latest.{ext}. The latest version exists as copy by default. To make it a symlink, set the project setting versionless_mode to 'symlink'.

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Manual version</strong></p></td>
<td><p>If set to true(checked), the incoming file name can dictate what the version of the checked-in snapshot appears as. For intance, if the incoming file name is dessert_v005.jpg, the version will appear as version 5. Another example is sun_V0030.0010.jpg. The version will appear as version 30. It tries to recognize the number immediately after the v or V in the file name. Zero or negative numbers are ignored. If such a version already exists, the check-in will throw an error</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Condition</strong></p></td>
<td><p>It can be set up so that differnet naming is adopted based on a particular attribute of the sObject. For instance, for the sType prod/asset, one can assign 2 naming entries. The default naming where the condition is left blank is adopted in most circumstance. The second special naming is adopted when the category attribute equals 'vehicle' by using this expression @GET(.category) =='vehicle'.</p></td>

**Example A**

In the following example, the file is being checked in withe general
'publish' context

**File:** *characterFile.ma*

**Checkin Context:** publish

**Desired output:**
sample3d/characters/character001/character001\_publish\_v001.ma:

      {project.code}/{parent.title}/{sobject.code}

     {sobject.code}_{snapshot.context}_v{snapshot.version}.{ext}

**Example B**

In the following example, the shot RC\_001\_001 is part of the parent
sequence RC\_001 and is checked in with an 'animation' context. This will
also use the short hand expressions

**File:** shotFile.ma

**Checkin context:** animation

\*Desired
output:\*sample3d/shot/RC\_001/RC\_001\_001/scenes/RC\_001\_001\_animation\_v001.ma

      {project.code}/shot/{parent.code}/{sobject.code}/scenes

     {sobject.code}_{snapshot.context}_v{snapshot.version}.{ext}

**Example C**

In the following example, the desired file location is at the project
folder level to accommodate a cross-project library of files.

**File:** artFile.png

**Checkin context:** publish

**Desired output:** general/art001/art001\_publish\_v001.png

     general/{sobject.code}

     {sobject.code}_{snapshot.context}_v(snapshot.version}.{ext}

**Example D**

In the following example, a context and subcontext are used for checking
in to a final process for an art asset

**File:** artFileFinal.psd

**Checkin context/subcontext:** final/colourA

**Desired Output:**
finals/art001/final/photoshop/colourA/art001\_final\_colourA\_v001.psd

     finals/{sobject.code}/{snapshot.context[0]}/photoshop/{snapshot.context[1]}

     {sobject.code}_{snapshot.context[0]}_{snapshot.context[1]}_v{snapshot.version}.{ext}

**Example E**

In the following example, the shot RC\_001\_001 is part of the parent
sequence RC\_001 and is checked in with an 'animation' context. Also when
a user checks out the sandbox, files should be organized into a user
folder.

**File:** shotFile.ma

**Checkin context:** animation

**Desired Repo output:**
sample3d/shot/RC\_001/RC\_001\_001/scenes/RC\_001\_001\_animation\_v001.ma

**Desired Sandbox output:**
sample3d/albert/shot/RC\_001/RC\_001\_001/scenes/RC\_001\_001\_animation\_v001.ma

     {project.code}/shot/{parent.code}/{sobject.code}/scenes

     {project.code}/{login.login}/shot/{parent.code}/{sobject.code}/scenes

     {sobject.code}_{snapshot.context}_v{snapshot.version}.{ext}

**Example F**

In the following example, the shot RC\_001\_001 is part of the parent
sequence RC\_001 and is checked in with an 'animation' context. Also when
a user checks out the sandbox, files should be organized into a user
folder. Since we also want to define a latest versionless, we need a
second entry with the same information, and with the latest\_versionless
check-box checked. In this example we are putting the versionless file
in the same directory, but you can put it in a different one if desired.

**File:** shotFile.ma

**Checkin context:** animation

**Desired Repo output:**
sample3d/shot/RC\_001/RC\_001\_001/scenes/RC\_001\_001\_animation\_v001.ma

**Desired Repo latest versionless output:**
sample3d/shot/RC\_001/RC\_001\_001/scenes/RC\_001\_001\_animation\_latest.ma

**Desired Sandbox output:**
sample3d/albert/shot/RC\_001/RC\_001\_001/scenes/RC\_001\_001\_animation\_v001.ma

Entry 1

     {project.code}/shot/{parent.code}/{sobject.code}/scenes

     {project.code}/{login.login}/shot/{parent.code}/{sobject.code}/scenes

     {sobject.code}_{snapshot.context}_v{snapshot.version}.{ext}

Entry 2

     {project.code}/shot/{parent.code}/{sobject.code}/scenes

     {project.code}/{login.login}/shot/{parent.code}/{sobject.code}/scenes

     {sobject.code}_{snapshot.context}_latest.{ext}

     true

**Example G**

In the following example, a texture file is checked in under shot
RC\_001\_001. Also when a user checks out the sandbox, files should be
organized into a user folder. Since we also want to define a current
versionless, we need a second entry with the same information, and with
the current\_versionless check-box checked. In this example, we are
retaining the original file name

**File:** shotFile.ma

**Checkin context:** animation

**Desired Repo output:**
sample3d/shot/RC\_001/RC\_001\_001/texture/my\_tree\_texture.jpg

**Desired Repo latest versionless output:**
sample3d/shot/RC\_001/RC\_001\_001/texture/my\_tree\_texture\_CURRENT.jpg

**Desired Sandbox output:**
sample3d/albert/shot/RC\_001/RC\_001\_001/scenes/my\_tree\_texture.jpg

Entry 1

     {project.code}/shot/{parent.code}/{sobject.code}/textures

     {project.code}/{login.login}/shot/{parent.code}/{sobject.code}/textures

     {basefile}.{ext}

Entry 2

     {project.code}/shot/{parent.code}/{sobject.code}/textures

     {project.code}/{login.login}/shot/{parent.code}/{sobject.code}/textures

     {basefile}_CURRENT.{ext}

     true

**Example H**

In the following example, asset file name is made up of asset\_code,
context, and version by default. If the assetâ€™s category is '2D' , we
will add this category as a suffix to the name

**File:** my\_chr001.jpg

**Checkin context:** model

**Desired Repo output:** sample3d/asset/chr001/chr001\_model\_v001.jpg

**Second Desired Repo output:**
sample3d/asset/chr003/chr003\_model\_v001\_2D.jpg

**Desired Sandbox output:** sample3d/dan/asset/chr001/my\_chr001.jpg

Entry 1

     {project.code}/asset/{sobject.code}

     {project.code}/{login.login}/asset/{sobject.code}

     {sobject.code}_{context}_{version}.{ext}

Entry 2

     {project.code}/asset/{sobject.code}

     {project.code}/{login.login}/asset/{sobject.code}

     {sobject.code}_{context}_{version}_{sobject.category}.{ext}

     @GET(.category)=='2D'

**Example I**

In the following example, the 'Checkin Type' is set to be (auto), to use
the filename as the subcontext.

The checkin type "(main)", uses the process as context.

The checkin type "(strict)" could also be available as a checkin type.

**File:** shotFile.ma

**Checkin context:** design/shotFile.ma

\*Desired Repo output:\*finals/art001/photoshop/design/shotFile.ma

      finals/{sobject.code}/photoshop/{snapshot.context}

     (auto)

     {sobject.code}_{snapshot.context}_v{snapshot.version}.{ext}

**Example J - keywords: snapshot and file**

The following is an example of the proper way to use the special
keywords **snapshot** and **file** in an expression to retrieve the snapshot
and file object for a checkin:

    {@GET(snapshot.context)}

    {@GET(file.type)}

Notice that the syntax for these particular expressions deviates from
the syntax of typical TACTIC expressions.

In the example below, \\{$PROJECT} is used to replace \\{project.code}.

Below is an example using these expressions of a file being checked in
with the general 'publish' context:

**File:** *source\_art\_v0001.jpg*

**Checkin Context:** publish

**Desired output:** sample3d/chr/chr001/publish

      {$PROJECT}/chr/{@GET(.code)}/{@GET(snapshot.context)}

     source_art_v{@GET(snapshot.context).version,%04.d}.{@GET(file.type)}

**Example K - Combination of TACTIC expression language syntax and the
original keyword approach**

The following is an example of directory naming using the TACTIC
expression language syntax and the original keyword approach. It will
also use expression language syntax to specify the condition.

    {@GET(snapshot.process)}

    {@GET(file.name)}

Notice that the syntax for these particular expressions deviates from
the syntax of typical TACTIC expressions.

In the example below, the keyword approach \\{project.code}, can be used
with expression language \\{@GET(.code)}.

Below is an example using these expressions of a file being checked in
with the process 'finish', the 'Condition' entry defines a specific
category called '2D' and the 'Context' entry will only allow you to
check in the files that have the process design:

**File:** *source\_art\_v001.jpg*

**Checkin Context:** design

**Desired output:** sample3d/chr001/design

      {project.code}/{@GET(.code)}/{@GET(snapshot.process)}

     Design/*

     {project.code}/{login.login}/asset/{sobject.code}

     {@GET(file.name).version,%03.d}.{@GET(file.type)}

     @GET(.category)=='2D'
