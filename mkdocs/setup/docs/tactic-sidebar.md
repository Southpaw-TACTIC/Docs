# Sidebar Configuration

![image](media/1_tactic_sidebar_overview.png)

**Description**

The TACTIC sidebar is the main menu system for navigating through the
views of all TACTIC search types. The access rules applied to a specific
account determine the contents of the sidebar as well as which views and
search types are displayed when a user is logged in.

The items in the sidebar provide links to existing views of the
different search types within a project. These views are built by your
organization’s production manager based on a selection of columns
(properties), layouts (order and column width) and a search. If a search
view is available, it provides a dynamic report based on the definition
of the search.

Users at different levels can configure the sidebar to include only
those views they need, or to include views that manage items and their
relationships. For example, a user may want to set up a view where only
the name, code and description of their own "storyboards" as in the
view. Or, the user may set up a view where, for example, only those
storyboards with a name containing the word "episode" and where child
tasks have a status of "review" are in the view.

The sidebar is divided into three different categories, "Project Views",
"My Views" and "Admin Views".

**Project Views and My Views**

The Project Views provides a way to save project wide views that
everyone across the entire project would want to see. It also has a
manageable list of custom user views.

The Project Views can be defined by the person in the role of the
project manager. Views can also be hidden from specific user groups.

**My View** contains a list of links to views that were created by the
login user themselves. These usually are created by the user to cater to
their own personal work flow.

**Admin Views**

**Admin Views** displays the project schema and the TACTIC system and
administration schemas. Access to the Admin Views section of the sidebar
is generally reserved for admin level users.

**Project Setup** - After initial creation of the project, this view
contains the tools to setup the project: Create the Schema, Create
Workflow, Manage the Side Bar.

**My Admin** - My Admin holds views that will allow the users to manage My
Views and My Preferences.

**Schema Views** - The schema view provides a hierarchical view of all of
the search types in a project. The schema view can be a starting point
when to create a project or user view.

![image](media/8_tactic_sidebar_Project_Schema.png)![image](media/9_tactic_sidebar_Config_Schema.png)![image](media/10_tactic_sidebar_Admin_Schema.png)

The **Admin Schema** appears in the schema sidebar and is accessible by
users in the admin group. The Admin Schema provides access to types at
the project and server level (e.g. users, groups, triggers and
pipelines).
