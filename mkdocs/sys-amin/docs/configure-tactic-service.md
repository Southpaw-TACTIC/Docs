# Configure the TACTIC Service

For development, test, or evaluation purposes, there is no need to run
TACTIC as a service. The `startup_dev.py` script should suit these
purposes adequately. However, for production, it is highly recommended
to run TACTIC as a service.

In the `<TACTIC_INSTALL_DIR>/src/install` directory, there is a
directory called `service`, with two files:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>[multiblock cell omitted]</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>[multiblock cell omitted]</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
