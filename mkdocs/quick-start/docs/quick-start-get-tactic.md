You can setup a TACTIC server environment using one of the following packages available from the TACTIC Community [downloads page](http://community.southpawtech.com/community/link/downloads).


1. TACTIC VM Image - setup documentation available [here](http://community.southpawtech.com/docs/sys-admin/tsi-setup-and-install/). 
    This is the fastest way to try TACTIC. The TACTIC VM is a self-contained server environment that you can host on your own computer.

2. TACTIC RPM for Fedora, and CentOS and RHEL - installation documentation available [here](http://community.southpawtech.com/docs/sys-admin/install-tactic-rhel/).

3. TACTIC Enterprise for Linux and NT systems - general installation documentation available [here](http://community.southpawtech.com/docs/sys-admin/install-tactic-general/).
