Framecycler Plugin Usage
------------------------

The idea of this integration is to be able to view sequence file checkin
inside of Framecycler with a single button.

The Framecycler integration is a simple script call. When the button is
pressed Tactic will retrieve the correct data and launch Framecycler.
The script will automatically import the data into a Framecycler
session.

Below is the image of the element within the snapshot config that
creates the Framecycler button.

This element can be dropped into any search type. We advise that this
element to be setup for a snapshot view.

checkin snapshot view.
