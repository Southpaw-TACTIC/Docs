Nuke Plugin Usage
-----------------

*Tactic and Nuke Integration UI*

Once Nuke is fully installed. The UI can be access by first inserting it
to the view using the Column Manager. By clicking on the Nuke Button
Tactic will popup a the Nuke Widget window.

*Nuke Widget Workflow*

The idea in this widget is to be able to load Nuke straight from tactic
as well as the ability to have Nuke scene files checked in and out of
Tactic.

The Launch Nuke button will only load a brand new single Nuke session.

Once a Nuke session is populated with work, this session is ready to be
checked into Tactic.

A description of the checkin can be entered into the description text
box.

There is also a context drop down menu to choose what process the Nuke
file is going to be checked into.

_*Note - At the moment context can only be changed at the config._

_- In the side bar go to the Widget Config and search through the config
of nuke_wdg view. In this config the context can be changed._

The Checkin button will submit the Nuke scene that is currently open
with the context and description information that is applied to it.

_*Note - At the moment only a single Nuke session must be open during a
Checkin process._

Tactic also has the ability to load checkin files. Under the history is
a list of all Nuke checkins. Here we can select the specific snapshot
and with the Load Selection button , the selected Nuke scene will load.
