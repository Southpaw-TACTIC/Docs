get_resource_path
-----------------

*get_resource_path(login=None)*

Get the resource path of the current user. It differs from
create_resource_paths() which actually create dir. The resource path
identifies the location of the file which is used to cache connection information.
An exmple of the contents is shown below:

[source,python]
------------------------------------------------------------
        login=admin

        server=localhost

        ticket=30818057bf561429f97af59243e6ef21

        project=unittest

        site=vfx_site

------------------------------------------------------------

The contents in the resource file represent the defaults to use
when connection to the TACTIC server, but may be overriden by the
API methods: set_ticket(), set_server(), set_project() or the
environment variables: TACTIC_TICKET, TACTIC_SERVER, and TACTIC_PROJECT

Typically this method is not explicitly called by API developers and
is used automatically by the API server stub. It attempts to get from
home dir first and then from temp_dir is it fails.

The site key is optional and used for a portal setup.

*param:*

*login (optional)* - login code. If not provided, it gets the current system user
