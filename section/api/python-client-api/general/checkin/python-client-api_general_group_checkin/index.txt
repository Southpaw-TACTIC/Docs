*group_checkin(search_key, context, file_path, file_range,
snapshot_type="sequence", description="", file_type='main',
metadata=\{}, mode=None, is_revision=False, info=\{} )*

Check in a range of files. A range of file is defined as any group

of files that have some sequence of numbers grouping them together.

An example of this includes a range frames that are rendered.

Although it is possible to add each frame in a range using add_file,

adding them as as sequence is lightweight, often significantly reducing

the number of database entries required. Also, it is understood that

test files form a range of related files, so that other optimizations

and manipulations can be operated on these files accordingly.

*param:*

*search_key* - a unique identifier key representing an sobject

*file_path* - expression for file range: ./blah.####.jpg

*file_type* - the typ of file this is checked in as. Default = 'main'

*file_range* - string describing range of frames in the form '1

*keyparam:*

*snapshot_type* - type of snapshot this checkin will have

*description* - description related to this checkin

*file_type* - the type of file that will be associated with this group

*metadata* - add metadata to snapshot

*mode* - determines whether the files passed in should be copied, moved
