add_dependency
--------------

*add_dependency(snapshot_code, file_path, type='ref')*

*Append a dependency referent to an existing check* - in.

All files are uniquely containe by a particular snapshot. Presently,

this method does a reverse lookup by file name. This assumes that

the filename is unique within the system, so it is not recommended

unless it is known that naming conventions will produce unique

file names for every this particular file. If this is not the

case, it is recommended that add_dependency_by_code() is used.

*param:*

*snapshot_code* - the unique code identifier of a snapshot

*file_path* - the path of the dependent file. This function is able

reverse map the file_path to the appropriate snapshot

*keyparam:*

*type* - type of dependency. Values include 'ref' and 'input_ref'

ref = hierarchical reference: ie A contains B

input_ref = input reference: ie: A was used to create B

*tag* - a tagged keyword can be added to a dependency to categorize

the different dependencies that exist in a snapshot

*return:*

*dictionary* - the resulting snapshot
