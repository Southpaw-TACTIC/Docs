Searchable Type (sType)
-----------------------

Within a project, there are many types of objects to manage, and each
object type requires different properties and types of files to be
stored. TACTIC uses *Search Types* to categorize the many types of
objects that can exist in a project. Search Types are templates that
determine how these objects are defined and handled. Views, pipelines,
naming conventions, access rules (and more) are all defined based on
assignment to a Search Type.

The basic architecture of the TACTIC system is built around interaction
with objects through their Search Types. These objects or "instances of
a Search Type" are called Search Objects or *SObjects*. The TACTIC
interface is simply a layer of widgets (tools) delivered through a web
browser that are provided for the user to search for SObjects, display
them, and interact with them based on their Search Types.
