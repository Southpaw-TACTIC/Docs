Checkin
-------

Checkins in Tactic is generally the process of placing and registering
all of the files that represent a "snapshot" of that object. This
snapshot is a package in itself that understands all of the versioning
and location for all files and/or folders that are a part of that
checkin.

With the notion of each Search Object being a container, creating
snapshots can be compared to creating and storing packages in this
container.

From the back-end of Tactic the great aspect of this process is that
this package is simply meta data that points to where the actual files
and folders live in the file system. The main benefits of this that if
Tactic we to be shut off, the files system will still be available and
very well organized.
