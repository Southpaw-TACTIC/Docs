A TACTIC project defines a real-world project or separates one of its
timelines. Each TACTIC project has its own separate database and
structure. Projects are the highest level separation in TACTIC. They
represent a separation in workflow, Searchable Types, Views, Access
Rules, Naming Conventions Pipelines and more

Custom TACTIC projects can be built from the ground up to manage
specific types of objects, processes and files. Alternatively,
predefined, ready-to-use TACTIC project modules are available to
expedite the setup process and provide custom integration tools
appropriate for the project type.
