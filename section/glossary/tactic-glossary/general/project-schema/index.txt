Project Schema
--------------

The project schema defines the hierarchy between Search Types in TACTIC.
The schema definitions are stored in a "schema" SObject which stores the
parent and child relationships between the various Search Types in the
project. The schema is automatically updated when search_types are
created in TACTIC, and can be modified in a schema view.

Searchable Types define how you want to manage your objects and also
define a separation in pipelines, views, checkin methods and more. They
are some of the most important configuration aspects of TACTIC. The
majority of the TACTIC architecture is built around the use of search
types for the needs of the project as well as many of the system level
aspects.
