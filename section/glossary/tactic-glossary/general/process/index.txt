Process
-------

A process is a definable phase in the pipeline of an asset. Processes
require some type of delivery upon completion, and often require that an
asset be checked in as part of the delivery mechanism. A process is
typically assigned to one person or one department. For large projects,
a single department could be assigned many processes.
