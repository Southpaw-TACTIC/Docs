Project Workflow
----------------

Pipelines define a hierarchical set of processes that lay out all of the
production and approval steps an SObject must go through before being
completed. It is important to note that each process contains its own
set of approvals (task pipeline). Typically a process must be completed
before it can be handed off to the downstream process or processes.
TACTIC uses pipelines in this manner: when a process is approved, the
next downstream processes receive the green light to start.
