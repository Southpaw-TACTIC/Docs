Event
-----

The TACTIC system is based on events, and every interaction with any
SObject is tracked. Events may include changing a status, adding a note
or checking in a file (to list but a few examples). Every event is
logged into a transaction log, and can be undone. The transaction log is
very valuable because it enables easy tracking of when something
happened and who did it.

An event can also execute another event in the system (or a "trigger").
Triggers are set up as custom scripts which can be configured to do
almost anything in TACTIC through the TACTIC Client API. Example uses of
triggers include changing the status of another task SObject, checking
in additional files, or executing an external rendering application.
