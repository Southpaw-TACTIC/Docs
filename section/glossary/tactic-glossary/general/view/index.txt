View
----

Views in the TACTIC interface are built using a "Table" widget that is
defined based on a Search Type. Views can be configured to display
specific properties (columns) and also the widgets (tools) that are used
to display them.

Views can also be filtered to control which SObjects are displayed with
search tools. For example, search tools can create reports, or views
summarizing which SObjects are at which stages in the pipeline. Views
and reports can be saved as either project views, visible to multiple
team members, or as personal views, visible to individuals ("My Views").
