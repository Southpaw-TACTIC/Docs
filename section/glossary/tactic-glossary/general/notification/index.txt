Notification
------------

Notifications are triggers built to execute on specific configured
events, and can be internal to TACTIC (notification SObjects), or even
emails sent externally. Notifications can be configured to run based on
rules that define the conditions that must be met in order to send out a
message. Conditions help to streamline who receives a notification for a
particular event, as well as the conditions specific to the event.
