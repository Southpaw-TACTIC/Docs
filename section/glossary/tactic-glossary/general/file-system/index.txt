File System
-----------

When files are checked in to TACTIC, they are passed through the
directory and file naming conventions. This relieves the user of the
responsibility of figuring out where to place files on the server and
what to name them. Naming conventions are defined using the "naming"
Search Type, which stores an expression used by TACTIC to generate the
location and name for a file upon checkin.
