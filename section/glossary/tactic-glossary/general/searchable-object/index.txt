Searchable Object (sObject)
---------------------------

SObjects in TACTIC are not actual physical files, but instead they are
descriptive containers that store all the information necessary to
define an object and track it. If the definition of the Search Type
permits, an SObject can contain relationships to child SObjects.
Separate SObject children can be used to store extra data. For example,
they could be "task" SObjects set up based on the pipeline to track
approvals and notes, or they could be "snapshot" SObjects that store
file checkin and location information.

In a project, an SObject can be used to store the production data for
any digital asset requiring multiple associated files. When you create a
new SObject, you must create it based on a Search Type (for example, the
"model" Search Type). When you insert this new SObject, you are simply
inserting a new entry into the "model" Search Type's library. Based on
the associated template Search Type, the new SObject will require
specific data to be inserted. For example, a name, description, pipeline
code and so on.
