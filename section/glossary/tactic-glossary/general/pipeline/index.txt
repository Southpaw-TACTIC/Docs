Pipeline
--------

Searchable Type metadata may also include a "pipeline_code" property to
link the SObject to a pipeline SObject. In this event, task SObjects are
also created from the pipeline's processes to define the processes the
SObject will pass through as it progresses through its production. When
tasks (processes) are defined, they ensure that an asset can only move
along the pipeline with all checkpoints complete. For example, they can
determine that the assigned user checks in files, generates notes, sets
task status and receives management approvals. After all of the
associated tasks for the SObject are approved and it is packaged up and
marked complete, its production history information, files, and data are
all still available as a package.
