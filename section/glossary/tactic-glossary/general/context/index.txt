Context
-------

To allow for separate versioning of files within the same SObject
(container) during checkin, TACTIC uses "versions" and "contexts."
Snapshot data always includes this information.

*Contexts* define a separate "channel" for checking in files. For
example, one SObject may require separate files to be checked in for
different tasks. For example, in the following list one drawing file is
checked into a single SObject with both "rough" and "final" contexts
(and with multiple versions). In this case, the contexts represent files
checked in for both the 'rough' and 'final' processes (tasks).
