Checkouts in Tactic is when a user requests a particular snapshot. This
request from the users standpoint can simply be a request for the
current material which prompts TACTIC to deliver all of the files as
well as any other dependant files to the user.

There are 2 ways for a user to actually retrieve the files for a
snapshot.

1.  The files can be loaded directly from the filesystem/fileserver.
This way, the files are not copied to the users machine, they are left
where they are and simply loaded up. For this to work, you would have to
have direct access to the Tactic assets directory but can be more
efficient as the files are not moved.
2.  The files can be downloaded to the local sandbox where a user can
work on them and save files however they like then when ready to commit
a checkin, do so through Tactic. The sandbox is good in situations where
the user is either off-site or there may be bandwidth issues opening the
files directly.
