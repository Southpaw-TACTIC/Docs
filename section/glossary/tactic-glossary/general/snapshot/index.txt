Snapshot
--------

A snapshot describes an asset at a particular point in time. This
description is sufficient to reproduce the asset completely at that
point in time. TACTIC has its own XML description language to completely
define assets and their dependencies to other assets.

A snapshot can contain any number of files. For example, in a Flash
production, a typical checkin will result in 4 files: a .fla (the flash
file to work on), .swf (a viewable file), and 2 pngs which represent a
small icon and a large viewable image.

Every time something is checked in, a new snapshot is created of the
asset. Snapshots can reference other snapshots, which allows TACTIC to
define dependencies to other assets or other snapshots of the same
asset.
