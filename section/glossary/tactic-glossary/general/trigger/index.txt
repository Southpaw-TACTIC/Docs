Trigger
-------

Triggers are specific tools and scripts that are executed based on
events which occur in Tactic. Within the project setup, there are tools
which help setup triggers and notifications with simple tools. Although
if required, these Triggers can be quite complex. Using the TACTIC
Client API, you can achieve almost anything. For example, a trigger can
be called when a task's status is changed. This type of trigger would
first check what the status was changed to, and then only proceed to
carry out a set of tasks if the status was, for example, "approved".
This may be as simple as changing the status of another task or as
complex as loading the final checkin for that task, render it to a video
file and then check it back into TACTIC.
