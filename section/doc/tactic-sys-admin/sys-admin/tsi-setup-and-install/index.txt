TACTIC VM Setup and Install
---------------------------

The TACTIC VM lets you run a virtual machine on Windows or Linux, and
provides an easy way to evaluate the TACTIC platform without changing
your operating system. The VM requires VMware Player for Windows or
Linux,

*_Q._* Will my computer be adversely affected if I run VM ?

*_A._* Your computer will not be affected by the VM. Aside from
requiring a large amount of memory (the TSI unzips into a folder needing
at least 5-10 GB), the TACTIC virtual machine does not interact with
your host machine. At the end of the evaluation period, you can either
continue using the TSI for production, migrate your data to a new full
server install or simply delete the TSI directory. (Note that if you
delete the TSI directory, all evaluation data you entered into the
TACTIC evaluation is destroyed.)

*Request and download the TACTIC Server Image (TSI)*

The TSI is available on request from Southpaw Technology. When you
contact the Southpaw sales or support representatives and set up an
evaluation account, they will send you a URL and login/password
information so you can begin the trial.

For more information, visit:

http://www.southpawtech.com[*http://www.southpawtech.com*]

*Download VMware Player or server*

The VMware player is a license-free player you can download from

*http://vmware.com/download/player/ [http://vmware.com/download/player/]*

VMware currently supports Microsoft Windows XP, Windows Vista and many
flavors of Linux. To streamline the evaluation process, we chose the
Fedora Linux-based operating system to create the TSI virtual machine
image. (Although you will be running the VM on any of many supported
operating systems, you will see the Fedora Linux when you use the VM.)

*Download VMware Server*

The VMware server is a full-featured service for Virtual machines

VMware server is a service that allows users to run VMs silently in the
background. No window is needed, and the server can be configured to run
the VM on host machine startup. Additionally, there are several
interesting options that allow for more flexible operation of a VM.

* *Web UI*
* *Pause* The ability to pause a VM is useful for cycling the VM host.
* *Snapshot a VM* The VMs current state can be saved and recalled in the
future. Note that if the VM is reverted to a snapshot, then any changes
that have occurred since the snapshot was taken will be permanently
deleted.
* *Change hardware* The VM can be modified to change hardware. For
example, another network interface, or a USB interface

*Note*

The instructions for running a VM can be found in the VMware server
documentation. Running the VM from VMware player is covered in this
document.

*Web Browser*

We recommend you use Mozilla Firefox as your web browser to access the
TSI. You can download Firefox at:

*http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/ [http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/]*

*Login Info*

There are three sets of login info to remember:

1.  VM Linux user
+
user: root password: south123paw
2.  TACTIC UI in browser
+
user: admin password: tactic
3.  Windows Samba share
+
user: apache password: south123paw

*Networking*

When VMware software is installed, several new network interfaces can
become available, depending on the options selected during the
installation process. Although any one of the interfaces can be used to
connect to the VM, it is advised to install all three network
interfaces, as this allows the most flexibility

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
*Note*

Successful operation of a virtual machine may require some input from
system administrators within a network environment.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

* NAT
** If it becomes necessary to isolate the VM on a host machine, then the
NAT interface can be used to connect to the VM.
** Internet and LAN connectivity can be utilized through the NAT
interface if the host machine is connected to an external network such
as the internet or a LAN. Allowing the VM to communicate with a LAN may
require changes to the routing system on the LAN. If this is a
requirement, then bridged networking may be the better option.
** NAT is a complete network that originates at the host machine, and is
a self-contained router with DHCP services. The VM, once run, will
usually ask the host machine for an IP address to assign to a network
interface. The host machine can then connect to the VM interface through
this IP.

* Bridged
** If there are machines other than the host machine that are required
to connect to the VM, then the bridged connection should be used.
** The only requirement that bridged networking has is that there are
appropriate services for the operation of the interface, such as DHCP on
the host machines network. If these services do not exist, then the VM
network interface needs to have manually set options.
* Host Only
** To isolate the TSI completely, the “Host Only�? option can be used.
** Host Only is a complete network that originates at the host machine,
and is a self-contained router with DHCP services. The VM, once run,
will usually ask the host machine for an IP address to assign to a
network interface. The host machine can then connect to the VM interface
through this IP.
** The VM is completely isolated from the host machines LAN. There is no
network connectivity, therefore no LAN or internet will be available on
the VM.

After you start up the VMware Player, click on the *Open* option to
browse for a virtual machine.

Browse to where the unzipped VM is. Open the `TACTIC_VM_3.8.0.v04.vmx`
file. The TSI will start up in the VMware Player.

When you first start the VM, you are presented with a window asking
whether the virtual machine was moved or copied. Click the "I copied it"
button.

image:media/movedOrCopied.png[image]

Start-up messages scroll by after the Linux kernel boots in the VM
window. After the boot-up is completed, you will see this prompt:

image:media/TSI_loginScreen.png[image]

If you see this prompt, the TACTIC VM has started up correctly. If it
does not show an IP address (for example, a number like
"192.168.25.138"), it means the virtual machine has not picked up an IP
address from a DHCP server. This IP address is required, so you must
contact your IT department to fix this situation. (Refer to the
Troubleshooting Section.)

Write down the IP address and any names you see such as
"localhost.localdomain". (You will need this information in a next
step.)

In special evaluation situations, there is a requirement for more disk
space than has been allocated for a standard evaluation (i.e. a large
amount of assets are to be stored, then the TSI "assets partition" can
be expanded.

Steps to expand disk space on a VM

1.  Shut down TACTIC
+
To shut down TACTIC, issue the command
+
service tactic stop
2.  Unmount the "TACTIC" drive
+
umount /home/apache
3.  Run the logical Volume expansion tool
+
lvextend -L+2G /dev/mapper/VolGroup00-LogVol00
+
This example command resizes the logical volume by +2 G, as seen in the
command itself. The volume can be expanded to the total size of the
virtual disk.
4.  Run the filesystem consistancy checker to make sure the filesystem
is ok
+
e2fsck -f /dev/mapper/VolGroup00-LogVol00
5.  Resize the filesystem on the logical volume
+
resize2fs /dev/mapper/VolGroup00-LogVol00
6.  Re-mount the "assets" drive
+
-------------------------
mount /home/apache/assets
-------------------------
7.  Restart TACTIC
+
--------------------
service tactic start
--------------------

To make your evaluation easier, the TSI uses passwords that are easy to
guess and a Samba share. This could cause security issues, so your IT
department must be aware of your use of the TSI.

If at any point during the usage of the VM there is a need to reset the
VM back to its original state, simply delete or archive the directory
with the TSI data, and re-expand the zip file that was downloaded from
the community site.
