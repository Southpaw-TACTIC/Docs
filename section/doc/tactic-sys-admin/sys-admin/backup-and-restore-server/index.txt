TACTIC Backup and Restore
-------------------------

Like any other data producing service, TACTIC requires a backup regimen.
The data in that TACTIC produces and manages must be backed up in
accordance with the backup policy of the departments that manage the
TACTIC service.

Backup policy definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
TACTIC managers should create a backup policy
for TACTIC data. A backup policy is extremely important, as data loss
within the TACTIC service is catastrophic.

What needs be backed up
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
TACTIC manages data in three parallel scopes:

* `versioned assets` Versioned assets are all the files that are checked
in and out of the tactic service.
* `asset metadata` Asset metadata are all the data produced by user
interaction with the tactic service.
* `project metadata` Project metadata are all data produced by the
creation of a project within tactic the tactic service.

Tactic data is all of equal importance. The data is all interrelated,
and thus all data must be treated with equal importance in the backup
regimen.

Frequency of backups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The frequency of backup of tactic data depends on
the policies of the TACTIC managers. An examination of the frequency of
use of the tactic service, combined with the down time potentially
required to back up tactic data should be considered.

Backup methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
the only consideration that tactic managers should take
into account when creating a backup policy for tactic data is that
tactic data produced is synchronized. This is accomplished via a
transaction system within tactic. This transaction system relies on
co-services to store transacted data. During the backup process, tactic
and its co-services should be stopped to prevent any loss of
synchronization to these co-services.

*Versioned assets*Versioned assets are all the files that are checked in
and out of the tactic service. Typically the tactic service works in
conjunction with a co-service such as a network file storage service to
accomplish its tasks of asset management. Thus the task of backing up
tactic of versioned assets onto these systems usually overlaps with the
file management policies of the IT department. Most enterprise class
network file storage systems, and third party file backup systems can
accomplish the task of backing up tactic assets. Redundant raid storage,
snapshots, and offsite backups can all be utilized to accomplish version
and asset backups.

It is highly recommended that you back up your TACTIC server using a
regular schedule. In the event of a hardware failure, you will be able
to restore your TACTIC server fully from the latest backup if you have
taken the following three backup steps:

1. Back up the 'assets' directory

2. Dump the TACTIC database

3. Back up the TACTIC program directory

*Note*

You may want to stop the tactic service while you do your backup
process. To do so, run the following commands:

`service tactic stop`

`service tactic start`
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The 'assets' directory is the repository where TACTIC stores all of the
asset files. By backing up this directory, you can restore all of your
asset files in the event of a database crash into a clean TACTIC-managed
directory structure.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
*Note*

You may need to contact your TACTIC server administrator if your
'assets' directory has been redirected to another location.

For backup:
^^^^^^^^^^^

*Windows*

The 'assets' directory on a Windows install is located by default in:

`C:\assets`

*Linux*

The 'assets' directory on a Linux install is located by default in:

`/home/apache/assets`



For restore:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To restore the TACTIC 'assets' directory, you have to restore your
backup to the current 'assets' location.

To dump the TACTIC data base you need to log in to the PostgreSQL
database and perform a database dump.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
*Note*

For both Linux and Windows the database file is in the 'assets'
directory, although you may redirect the location to your backup
location. Also, the TACTIC default for the database is to have no
password. If you have added a password, you may need to enter it into
your postgres commands with the `-P` tag.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

For backup:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Windows*

`pg_dumpall -U postgres -c > c:\assets\tacticDatabase.sql`

*Linux*

`pg_dumpall -U postgres -c > /home/apache/assets/tacticDatabase.sql`

For restore:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To restore the TACTIC database run the command:

`psql -U postgres < tacticDatabase.sql`

This last step, although not completely necessary, is recommended
because it takes a snapshot of your TACTIC source code and project
settings at the time of backup.

For backup:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Windows*

The folders to back up are:

`C:\Program Files\southpaw\tactic`

`C:\Program Files\southpaw\projects`

*Linux*

The folders to back up are:

`/home/apache/tactic`

`/home/apache/projects`

For restore:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To restore the TACTIC program files, you have to restore the `tactic`
and `projects` directories to their original locations.
