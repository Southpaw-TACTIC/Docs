TACTIC VM Troubleshooting
-------------------------

1.  *The IP address does not show up when I start up the VM.*
+
It is possible that an IP address was not assigned because your host
machine is not connected to a network. Or, you have a special network
configuration that may require one of the following settings:
* Network with DHCP: bridged
* Network without DHCP: NAT
* No network: host-only
+
_*_Changing Windows Special Network Configurations_*_
+
In the top right corner of your VMware player, click on the down arrow
beside the Ethernet button and choose *host-only* , *NAT*, or *bridged*.
Make sure the *Connected* menu item is checked.
+
*_Changing Linux Special Network Configurations_*
+
In the top right corner of your VMware player, right-click on the
Ethernet button and choose *host-only*, *NAT*, or *bridged*. Make sure
the *Connected* menu item is checked.
+
If the problem persists, refer to the VMware Player documentation by
pressing F1.
2.  *I do not remember the IP address of the VMware virtual machine.*
+
In the VMware player, run the following command in the shell:
+
`ifconfig`
+
The IP is the internet address; for example, "192.168.14.101."
+
*Refreshing the IP Address*
+
If you change the Ethernet settings, you may need to restart the network
card in the VM. First, you will need to know its number: run the command
`ifconfig` in the VM shell. You should see a name similar to "ethX",
where X is the arbitrary number of the interface. To restart "ethX", run
the following commands:
+
`ifdown ethX`
+
`ifup ethX`

3.  *I get a proxy error in my browser that looks like the following:*
+
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proxy Error 

The proxy server received an invalid response from an upstream server. 
The proxy server could not handle the request /POST /tactic/admin/ <http://192.168.14.113/tactic/admin/>/

Reason: *Error reading from remote server
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
This message tells you the TACTIC service has stopped. If you are
running other processes on port 80 (for example, Skype), this can cause
a problem with the TACTIC service. Stop the conflicting service. Then
restart TACTIC in the VM by logging in as root and running the command:
+
`service tactic start `
