TACTIC Install - Windows Server 2008
------------------------------------

To completely install TACTIC Enterprise, there are three main components
that have to be set up in the following order:

1.  A Database
2.  The TACTIC Installer
3.  A Web Server

TACTIC stores all metadata in a database called PostgreSQL. This is an
industrial strength, hugely scalable database that has proven itself in
thousands of industries around the world. Go to the
http://www.postgresql.org[PostgreSQL website] for more information.

From the PostgreSQL site (http://www.postgresql.org), download the .msi
file for the latest binary distribution. We have encountered no problems
using any of the versions above 8.4. You can find the binary
distribution at this site. Follow the installation wizard for
PostgreSQL. It is safe to choose all of the default settings if you do
not have much experience with the PostgreSQL. It is best not to set a
password during installation, although the Windows installer may force
you to set one up.

Unzip Tactic Enterprise in a temporary location like C:/temp

It is mandatory you edit the "pg_hba.conf" file after installation

It is located in C:/Program Files/PostgreSQL/<version>/data This file
determines all of the user permissions for PostgreSQL. You can open this
file with any text editor like notepad. To begin with, turn on all of
the permissions contained in this file. This is a temporary measure that
will greatly simplify the installation process. You may lock down these
permissions at a later date. Please consult the PostgreSQL documentation
on how to do this. TACTIC ships with a sample "pg_hba.conf" file
(located in
<TACTIC_unzipped_package>/src/install/postgresql/pg_hba.conf). This file
has an open security setting for ease of installation. It's best to back
up your current pg_hba.conf file before copying over with the file
provided by TACTIC. Note: in Windows, you would need to comment out the
line

local all all trust

You add a comment by putting a '#' at the beginning of the line like
this:

#local all all trust

Add the PostgreSQL bin directory to the environment path in Advanced
System Settings: C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<version>\bin\

To do this, go to Start --> Control Panel. If it's organized in category
mode, go to system and security --> system. If its not categorized, you
should see system directly. In system, find advanced system and settings
--> go to the advanced tab --> Environment variables. Now in the system
variables box, Navigate to the variable "Path". Add the bin directory to
the end of the value.

Restart the PostgreSQL Service:

You can go to the control panel again to do this. If it's organized in
category mode, go to system and security --> administrative tools. If
it's not categorized, you will see administrative tools directly.
Inside, you can find services. Find the postgresql service and restart
it. Note: If you have command prompt open, you need to reopen it for the
environment variable to take effect.

*Verification*

Verify that psql works in the command prompt:

----------------------------
> psql -U postgres template1
----------------------------

It should give you a prompt:

-----------
template1=#
-----------

If you see this prompt without the need to enter a password, you have
successfully installed the PostgreSQL database. Type \q to exit.

*Install Python and supporting modules*

The TACTIC source code is written in Python. As such, the complete
codebase is open.

To install Python, you can find an msi at
http://www.python.org[*http://www.python.org*]. TACTIC requires Python
2.6 or higher.

TACTIC also requires a number of Python modules to function correctly.
These modules are generally not installed by default with the standard
Python distributions. For Windows, they are already packaged in a file
python_modules.zip available for download in the release section of the
downloads page at *http://community.southpawtech.com/downloads*

* PIL 1.1.7
+
(Python Image Library)
* ImageMagick 6.7.8
+
(A command line program which complements PIL) -
+
http://www.imagemagick.org
* *FFmpeg* *version 0.6*(Solution to record, convert and stream audio
and video and metadata parsing) -
link:www.imagemagick.org[http://www.ffmpeg.org]
* psycopg2 2.3.1
+
(Database connectivity)
* PyCrypto version 2.0.1/2.1
+
(For de-encrypting the license file) -
+
http://www.amk.ca/python/code/crypto
* simplejson 2.1.1 (not needed since Python 2.6)
+
simplejson.egg can be installed with the EasyInstaller. It is need for
JSON string encoding and parsing
* lxml 2.1 or 2.2
+
(XML and XPath processing)
* pywin32-(build 2##)
+
(Python Windows OS module)

*Windows*

Unfortunately, Python is not preinstalled on Windows machines; however,
with the installer this is not difficult.

The Python installer does not set the Python path, so this must be added

Go to
Start->Control Panel->System
Click on the "Advanced" tab.
Select "Path" under "System Variables" and click the "Edit" button.
Add Python to the environment path: "C:\Python26\" to the end of the
"Variable Value"
To test that Python is working from the command prompt, run the command:
`python`

You should get the following prompt:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Python 2.6.2 (#67, Sep 28 2009, 12:41:11) [MSC v.1310 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you haven't done so already above, unzip Tactic Enterprise in a
temporary location like C:/temp

Go to
C:/temp/tactic_#.#.#/src/install/
---------------------------------------
# cd C:/temp/tactic_#.#.#.#/src/install
---------------------------------------

Execute:
install.py
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
*Note*

You must invoke the installation with root user privileges because it
attempts to write to the <python_install>/site-packages directory.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

--------------------
# python install.py 
--------------------

The installer will ask a number of questions. First it ask for the
<TACTIC_BASE_DIR>:

------------------------------------------------------
Please enter the base path of the TACTIC installation:

(C:/Program Files/Southpaw) ->
------------------------------------------------------

It would copy the source code to the base path. An Apache Web Server
file will be generated at the end which you would need to copy to the
Apache config area upon installation of the web server. If there are
existing files in the destination directory the installer will ask for
your confirmation to remove it. At the end, you will see this:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing service TacticService
Changing service configuration
Service updated

*** Installation of TACTIC completed at [C:/Program Files/Southpaw] *** 
            
       
Next, please install the Apache Web Server and then copy the Apache config extension
[C:/Program Files/Southpaw/tactic_data/config/tactic_win32.conf] to the Apache web server config area. e.g.
C:/Program Files/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2/conf 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Verification*

When the installation is completed, an asset directory will be created
at '<TACTIC_BASE_DIR>/assets'.

The file tactic_paths.py will be created in the following directories:

*Windows*
--------------------------------------------------------
C:/Python##/Lib/site-packages/tacticenv

--------------------------------------------------------
Default contents:

--------------------------------------------------------
TACTIC_INSTALL_DIR='C:/Program Files/Southpaw/tactic' 
TACTIC_SITE_DIR='' 
TACTIC_DATA_DIR='C:/Program Files/Southpaw/tactic_data'
--------------------------------------------------------



*Network machine access*

If you are on the server, you can access it by using the URL
http://localhost/tactic. For other people to access it on the network,
you need to find out its IP address. In a linux server, you can use the
command "ifconfig" to locate it. It's the one listed as the inet addr.

Next, you need to run TACTIC behind Apache.

TACTIC should be run behind an Apache web server. You can download
Apache software at http://www.apache.org/

The TACTIC application server is able to serve up static content such as
images, PDF files, Quicktime files, and so on, but it is not the most
efficient at this because it is written in Python. This is what Apache
is designed for. By running TACTIC behind Apache, it relieves TACTIC
from serving the static content so that it can focus on the dynamic
content.

For production use, it is highly recommended that TACTIC is run behind
the Apache server. This has many scalability advantages. When running
behind Apache, Apache uses a reverse proxy and proxy balancer module to
forward requests to communicate with TACTIC.

*Windows*

After the installation, some changes may need to be made in the
"httpd.conf" file for Apache.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
C:/Program Files/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2/conf/httpd.conf
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure the following lines are uncommented:

--------------------------------------------------------------
LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so
LoadModule proxy_http_module modules/mod_proxy_http.so
LoadModule proxy_balancer_module modules/mod_proxy_balancer.so
LoadModule deflate_module modules/mod_deflate.so
--------------------------------------------------------------

These lines may already be uncommented, depending on your distribution
and version of Apache. You need version 2.0.31 or later.

The TACTIC installer generates an Apache extension conf file on
completion. You need to copy that file to a directory that is recognized
by Apache.

For Windowse: this directory is:

` C:/Program Files/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2/conf`

You must add the following line to the "httpd.conf" file so that it will
read the extension conf file provided by the installer:

------------------------------
Include conf/tactic_win32.conf
------------------------------

*Web Server configuration*

In our provided file:

-----------------
tactic_win32.conf
-----------------

Make sure the following lines exist:

-------------------------------------------
# Using the ProxyPass directives
ProxyPreserveHost on

<Proxy balancer://tactic>
BalancerMember http://localhost:8081/tactic
BalancerMember http://localhost:8082/tactic
BalancerMember http://localhost:8083/tactic
</Proxy>
ProxyPass /tactic balancer://tactic
ProxyPass /tactic_data balancer://tactic
-------------------------------------------

_____________________________________________
*Note*

Warning: For load balancing, only use either:

\1) the Proxy Balancer method (recommended)

*or*

\2) the RewriteRule method (not recommended).

Do *not* use both methods at the same time.
_____________________________________________

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
*Note*

For configuring load-balancing set-up in a real production, please refer
to the Load Balancing section in the Sys-admin docs.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
*Note*

When trying to set up Apache on a Windows Server, to specify a share
folder for Apache to use, you may need to include the name of the share
folder in the path.

For example, use the following if you have named the share folder
"my_share":

-------------------------------------------
Alias /assets "//10.0.0.17/my_share/assets"
-------------------------------------------
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Note: For configuring load-balancing set-up in a real production, please
refer to the Load Balancing section of this Sys-admin doc.

Finally, after verifying the configuration is correct, restart the
Apache service:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can do it in the Windows Services UI or through the task tray and right click on the Apache icon.
           
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go to the <TACTIC_INSTALL_DIR>/src/bin folder

`cd C:/Program Files/Southpaw/tactic/src/bin `

`python startup_dev.py`

This "startup_dev.py" script is the development script which will dump
output to the screen. The other startup script "startup.py" is the
production start-up script and will dump output to a log file. The
development start-up script is also much slower as it monitors the file
system to see if any files have changed.

The output would look like the following:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Registering site ... admin
Registering site ... default
Registering site ... test
Registering site ... my_project

`http://<TACTIC_server_address>/tactic/admin/`

You should see the TACTIC login appear.

image:media/sys-admin-tactic-windows-server-2008-loginScreen.png[image]

There is a default user created on installation. This is the "admin"
user and this user has the ability to see and change all aspects of the
system. Log in as the admin user:

.Note: You may be asked to change your password automatically at startup
without entering these default credentials.
[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|====================================================
|*user:* |`admin`
|*password:* |`tactic`
|====================================================

Note: The TACTIC service should have been set up during the
installation. You just need to start it.

First, stop TACTIC running in dev mode if applicable by pressing Ctrl +
C in that shell

In Windows, :

`Start the "Tactic Application Server" in Windows Services
        UI.`

image:media/windowsServices.png[image]

At this point you will need to install a TACTIC license file and then
begin to set up a project.

* For more information on installing the license file, please refer to
the Install License File chapter.*

* For more information on getting started with projects, please refer to
Setup documentation.*

*Note on supplementary directories used in TACTIC:*

In the config file <TACTIC_DATA_DIR>/config/tactic-conf.xml, you will
find different references to directory under the path /home/apache like
/home/apache/tactic_temp , assets, and handoff. They are there because
/home/apache is the base directory chosen for installation. You will
find the Windows equivalent in the Windows installation. It could be
different in your case. In the future, you can change their locations by
editing the config file. If the assets directory is changed, ensure it's
also updated in the Apache Web server config extension tactic.conf.

To view different information about the system and set-up, you can go to
the Global --> System Info page. For example, you can verify if
load-balancing is set up and certain key directories are writable by
TACTIC.

* If you see missing images on logging in or errors in the output log
saying certain js files are not found, it means the Apache extension
file tactic.conf is not being referenced or you have not updated the
paths in it to reflect current <TACTIC_INSTALL_DIR>. For example, if
your <TACTIC_INSTALL_DIR> is /home/apache/tactic, you should see the
line in tactic.conf:
+
-----------------------------------------------------------
Alias /context C:/Program Files/Southpaw/tactic/src/context
-----------------------------------------------------------
* If you try to check in a Preview Image and can't see the icon
generated, your assets alias in the Apache extension file may not be in
sync with the asset_base_dir in the TACTIC config file
tactic_linux-conf.xml
+
------------------------------------------------------
Alias /assets           C:/ProgramData/Southpaw/assets
------------------------------------------------------
+
should point to the asset_base_dir as found in tactic_win32-conf.xml
+
---------------------------------------------------------------
<asset_base_dir>C:/ProgramData/Southpaw/assets</asset_base_dir>
---------------------------------------------------------------
* If you want to re-run install.py, the installation will ask if you to
confirm backing up the sthpw database before dropping it. If you choose
to do it yourself, here is the command:
+
-----------------------------------------------
pg_dump -c -U postgres sthpw > sthpw_backup.sql
dropdb -U postgres sthpw
-----------------------------------------------
* If you try to connect to the http://<server IP>/tactic and it just
times out, your server firewall could be blocking access.
* If the Windows TACTIC Service has trouble starting up, you can try to
edit the Properties , go to Log On tab, and adjust the Log on as user
with the Windows login which has write/read access to the tactic_temp
location as well as the asset_base_dir location.
