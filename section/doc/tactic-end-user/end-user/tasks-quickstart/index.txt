Tasks Quickstart
----------------

After inserting a new item into a project, often the first things to do
is to create a new task, assign it and have the appropriate user work on
it.

1.  Load any view of items you wish to track tasks for.

2.  If the task status edit column is not in your view, you can add it
with the column manager or switch the Layout to "Task Schedule"

3.  If no tasks exist, click the (+) icon in the task status edit
column. Another option is to select the items and choose Tasks -> Add
Tasks to Selected from the Gear Menu. Both approaches will load the task
insert pop-up.

For now, click create tasks to create tasks for all process available in
the pipeline.

*Note*

If a pipeline has not been set up for the particular sType you will not
see any processes available in the UI. This will require building a
pipeline which is covered in the TACTIC Setup Documentation

4.  Once tasks are created, you will be able to assign them to users,
assign dates, priority etc.
