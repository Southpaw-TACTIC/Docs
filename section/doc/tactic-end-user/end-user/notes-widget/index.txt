Notes Widget
------------

*Introduction*

The Notes Widget provides the ability to add a note directly to an item
in the view. The notes are tracked in chronological order and and are
also grouped by process if entered against tasks. Other conveniences
provided in this widget is the ability attach files and to CC/BCC extra
email addresses when you submit the note.

*Adding a Note*

If the Notes widget is not in the view, it can be added through the
Column Manager.

To add a note, go to the Notes column and click on the plus sign in the
top right corner.

The "For process:" drop down allows you to select the pipeline process
to add the note to. If there is no pipeline for the item, then a default
process will be used for the note.

The Submit button will save the note to the item.

*Additional Note Options*

To attach a file, click on the Attach File(s) button. The file browser
will open to prompt to select a file.

Additional fields to input Cc or Bcc email addresses can be found at the
bottom, under Mail Options.

*Note*

If Notification Triggers have been set up in the project, emails will
automatially be sent to the appropriate users when notes are added.
Adding a CC email address to a note simply sends the note to the email
addresses regardless of Noification Triggers.
