*Introduction*

The Clipboard menu feature provides an easy method for transferring
items (row data) from one view to another. Items can also be copied
between different projects. This feature can be used similarly to the
copy and paste function that we are familiar with in most applications.

*The Clipboard Menu Options*

The features for the Clipboard can be found on the tool shelf under the
*Gear menu -> Clipboard*.

The individual options of the Clipboard menu are described in detail
below.

*Copy Selected*

This menu option copies the items to the Clipboard that you have checked
marked in the view. Either one row or multiple items can be copied. Once
the items have been copied to the Clipboard in memory, the destination
view has been navigated to, to allow pasting the items.

*Note*

The Clipboard has been built with the ability to copy and paste items
from one project to another.

*Add Selected*

This menu option copies the items that have been check marked and adds
them to the items that are already have on the Clipboard without wiping
out what is on the Clipboard. This menu option is useful especially when
navigating through different views to gather row data.

*Paste Clipboard*

This menu option pastes the items that have been stored in the Clipboard
into the view.

*Note*

Regarding copying and pasting to another project and the History column:
After pasting the contents of the Clipboard to the view, the latest
History of the item's check-ins will refer to the item under the
original path where the files live. The paths will point to the item in
the new project as soon as the first check-in transaction is completed
for this item under the new project.
