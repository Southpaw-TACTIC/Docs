Ingestion Widget
----------------

The Ingestion Widget is a tool to ingest a large number raw files into
TACTIC. The tool is often used immediately after the initial creation of
a new sType.

The Ingestion Widget is used to checkin files using the drag and drop
option. To find the tool, first go to *Project Configuration*. Next,
find the sType that you wish to add entries to.

In the Configuration view, click on the *View*column icon to view the
sType object to ingest. Next, in the bottom panel, right click on the
gear widget for that sType, hover over the File option from the dropdown
and select under *File -> Ingest Files*.

This pops up the following Ingest Files window.

Click on the *Add* tab and drag the files from a folder on your computer
into this TACTIC Ingest window. Next, hit the *Ingest* button to start
uploading the files. After TACTIC has completed uploading the files, it
will show a small pop-window

The difference between the Ingest Tool and the Checkin Widget is that
the context cannot be specified for the Ingest Tool. The Ingest Tool
simples uses the default context.
