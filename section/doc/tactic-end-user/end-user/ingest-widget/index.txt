Description
+++++++++++

The Ingest Widget is a tool to ingest a large number raw files into
TACTIC. The tool is often used immediately after the initial creation of
a new sType.

Usage
+++++

The Ingest Widget is used to checkin files using the drag and drop
option. To find the tool, first go to *Project Configuration*. Next,
find the sType that you wish to add entries to.

In the Configuration view, click on the *View* column icon to view the
sType object to ingest. Next, in the bottom panel, right click on the
gear widget for that sType, hover over the File option from the dropdown
and select under *File -> Ingest Files*.

This pops up the following Ingest Files window.

Click on the *Add* or drag the files from a folder on your computer
into this TACTIC Ingest window. Next, hit the *Ingest* button to start
uploading the files. After TACTIC has completed uploading the files, it
will display a small popup.

The difference between the Ingest Widget and the Checkin Widget is that
the context cannot be specified for the Ingest Tool. The Ingest Tool
simply uses the default context.

|=======================================================================
|*Metadata* |Pre-fill the metadata for the selected sType

|*Update mode* |When update mode is on, if a file shares the name of another file in the asset library, the file will version up on ingest. If more than one file shares the name of an ingested asset, a new asset is created.
If sequence mode is selected, the system will version up the matched sobject on ingest if a file sequence sharing the same name already exists.

|*Clear* |Clear the list of to-be-ingested items in the list

|*Add* |Instead of drag-and-drop, one can add a file at a time using the Add button
