File Browser Layout
-------------------

File Browser is a layout view option. It can be used to quickly browse
through items in the repository and to view their details. It displays
detailed information of the item such as the properties, options for the
checked-in files, track checkin history, view/edit tasks, pipelines and
to view/add notes to the items.

The File Browser can be selected as the default layout for your sType
when you create a new sType. You can also view sTypes with different
default layout by selecting the File Browser layout from the layout
dropdown in the sType view tab.

Users can browse through the items under the sType. When a specific
folder is selected, the contents of that folder can be viewed in the
mini-side bar panel on the left hand side. A view tab showing all the
items in that folder appears in the panel on the right hand side. This
view tab is similar in functionality to the view tab that opens using
view column for sTypes under Project Configuration.

If a file is selected, the three tabs on the right hand side will be
updated with details that correspond to the file.

The first tab, *File Info*, contains the properties of the selected file
in tabular form.

The second tab, *Notes*, displays the notes on the file made by other
users and allow you to add your own notes.

The third tab, *Full Item Detail*, has 4 other tabs under it: Check-in
history, Tasks, Checkin, Edit and Pipeline.
