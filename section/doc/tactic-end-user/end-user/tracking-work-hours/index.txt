Tracking User Work Hours
------------------------

The TACTIC system has built-in work hour tracking, which can be tracked
per task or work hours can be entered manually.

By default, hours can only be submitted to a task by the user that task
is assigned to. For example, if an asset has a pipeline process called
"texturing" and this process is assigned to the user Albert, then only
Albert can log work hours for this task.

Users log work hours in a task view with the "Work Hours" column.

Hours can be logged and edited per day, per task.

To view the logged hours, go to the *Work Hours* view. (This view shows
the hours for the user currently logged in.)

In the Work Hours view, you will see an item per time entry with totals
per day and per week based on hours logged on all assets.

To manually track work hours for other events (for example, daily
meetings), click the insert button and fill in the options in the pop-up
window:
