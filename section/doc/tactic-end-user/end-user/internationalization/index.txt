Internationalization
--------------------

TACTIC supports international unicode characters for almost all elements
in the interface. Mose elements in the interface accept unicode
character streams navtively. This makes it possible to customize a
project in any native language.

The following show an image of using TACTIC in Japanese:

The following sections of TACTIC are capable of using unicode
characters:

*Notes*

All notes, including the discussion widget and the notes sheet can
accept unicode characters.

*Data*

*Limitations*

There are certain areas where it is recommended to use Latin-1
characters. These sections may be able to use unicode characters for
certain uses, but areas have been found where these sections can cause
issues.

* *Project codes*: project codes are used to generate the URL of the
project and the database of the project. PostgreSQL accepts database
unicode database names quite well but URL with unicode characters are
not typically accepted or used. It is recommended that project codes
stay with alpha_numeric character set with underscores as a delimiter
* *Search Types*: search types are used to identify a type of sobject.
These search types are often identified in code. It is not typical to
see unicode characters in code, although this may be changing as
computers and languages support becomes more ubiquitous. However, there
are still many areas in computing where unicode characters are not
supported and it is possible that limitations will occur. The TACTIC
interface and database generally accept unicode strings with issue.
* *View Names*: View names are stored in the database as XML. An example
of this is as follows:
+
-------------------------
<config>
  <xxx>
    <element name="foo"/>
  </xxx>
</config>
-------------------------
+
where "xxx" is the view name. Most XML libraries will accept tags with
unicode characters, however, some do not support them completely. This
can cause issues when doing searches and xpath through xml documents.
For this reason, it is recommended to use alpha_numeric characters with
underscore delimiters for view names. The view name does not typically
appear in the user interface for users, so this does not usually cause
an issue.
