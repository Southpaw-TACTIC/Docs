The Multi-insert option is located within the table views gear menu, in
the edit option.

The idea of a multi-insert is to be able to duplicate SObjects. Here is
an example of a multi-insert view.

The most important values that must be entered are the Multiplier, and
the Code.

The number entered into the Multiplier box determines how many SObjects
that will be created.

Sequence code will determine which sequence the SObjects will be placed
under.

The Code value will be incremented by the value that is entered into the
Multiplier.

_*Note - The value of the Code must start with a letter._

All the other values are optional.
