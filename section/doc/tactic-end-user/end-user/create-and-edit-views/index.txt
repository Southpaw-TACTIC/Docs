Creating and Editing Views
--------------------------

image:media/NEW_tactic-window.png[image]

TACTIC provides the following configuration display options when
creating or editing a view:

* Which columns are part of the view
* The order of the columns
* The width of each column
* The Grouping of the items
* The Search which has been applied to the view

In TACTIC, there are 2 main distinctions between the types of views
*Project Views* and *My Views*. These are presented in 2 sections within
the main sidebar.

* *Project Views* - Project views are presented to all users in the
production and/or can be hidden based on group access rules. Project
views are also generally only created by the project manager and the
ability to save and modify them can also be blocked with group access
rules.
* *My Views*- My views are views saved per user. It allows for saving of
personal views outside of the project views. These will only be
available to the user who created them.

*Adding Columns*

To add a column, right-click on any column header in the view.

Select the *Column Manager*

In the column manager, selecting columns will add them to them current
view. The sections in the column manager are as follows:

* *Custom Widgets* - These are the custom widgets which have been
defined for the current type. These represent both changes to
information (i.e.. switching a code) as well as tools which represent
certain actions for that type (i.e.. a button which loads the asset into
an application)
* *Common Widgets* - These widgets are similar to the ones above but,
are common to all types in TACTIC. They are tools which are generally
universal.
* *Raw Database Columns* - These are the raw data (property) columns
which exist for the type. Generally, each is represented by a Property
Column but, this allows adding of the data in its raw format. For
example, a task has 'start_date' and 'end_date' database columns but,
there may be a 'schedule' column which displays the start_date and
end_date together in a calendar widget.

*Note*

Certain widgets require Java to be started up so, it can take a few
seconds for the selected column to actually appear in the view. When
finished, click the close button.

*Removing Columns*

To remove a column from the current view, left click in the column
header for the column to be removed and choose *Remove Column*. Columns
can also be removed through deselecting them in the column manager.

*Ordering Columns*

To re-order columns, click and drag a column in the header to the
desired location in the view. As the column header is dragged to the
left or the right, an orange bar will appear between the columns
indicating where the column appear if the mouse button is released.

*Resize Columns*

To resize a column width, hover the pointer over the divider between the
column headers and the mouse pointer will change to a width adjuster.

Left click and drag the width adjuster to change the width of the
column.

*Grouping*

Some columns in TACTIC contain categorical data. Some examples include
'status', 'parent', 'assigned user' columns. These columns can be
grouped.

For example, grouping by the Assigned User column displays the items in
groups by each user.

To apply grouping to a view, left click on the column header to be
grouped and choose *Group By*

*Search*

The Search Tool is used as a filter to only display items which match a
certain criteria. This allows the results in the view to be narrowed
down. When a view is saved, the search criteria is saved with the view
which causes the view to become a live report as each time the view is
loaded the search filter will be applied to the live data.

For example, if a search filter is created which shows only items which
have a child task with the status "Review", the view will provide a
report of all items which need to be reviewed. When the status of these
tasks are changed, the items will be filtered out and no longer appear
in the view.
