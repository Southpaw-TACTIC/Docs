*Insert/Edit Tasks*

There is more than one way to create new tasks. The following describes
explains each way.

*Task Menu*

Select the item to add tasks to. Then, go to the Gear menu for the view
and select *Tasks -> Add Tasks To Selected*.

Check mark the processes to add the task to and then hit *Add Tasks*.

The *skip duplicated* option skips adding a task that has already been
created for that process e.g. if only a task for design has already been
created.

Notice the new tasks added to the Task Pipeline column:

Another way to create a task is to create a task by *context*. This is
provided in the drop down selection menu.

*Task Status Column*

Once an item is created which has a pipeline, the widget will show a
green insert button (+). This will load the task creation GUI to create
tasks for the item.
