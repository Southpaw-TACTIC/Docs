Project Automation - Notifications
----------------------------------

*Description*

Notifications are sent to inform the user that a particular transaction
or event has occurred.

They are stored in a notification_log which can be found under *Admin
Views -> Site Admin -> Notifications*.

*Notifications.*

Notifications present information reported by transactions. They usually
include what items are created or updated in addition to a description
of the command. Below is an example of a notification:

With the mail server setting set up properly (set in the TACTIC Config
file), TACTIC can send out email notifications to users.

*Implementation*

There are 2 perspectives to work from when configuring notifications in
TACTIC.

* *Project Workflow* - Notifications can be set up per process in a
pipeline which are used to automate the pipeline/workflow
* *Project Schema* - Notifications can be set up at a simpler level
where any of the Raw Database events can be used to trigger a
notification regardless of process.

*Project Workflow*

In the Workflow Editor, right click on a process and choose *show
notification/trigger* to open a tab to define a trigger for that
particular process.

This will open a new Triggers tab in the panel at the bottom for the
assigned process.

Click the [+] button to insert a trigger. This will open the
trigger/notification UI.

Notifications and Triggers work together in many ways. A notification is
defined as an Action. To send a notification, an event must occur.

In the Action drop down list *Send a Notification* must be selected.

*Send a Notification* - This action will send a notification. The action
box will open additional options to insert a subject and message.

Below is an example of a notification being sent on the event when a
task status is changed to review:

The *Mail To:* and *Mail CC:* input fields accepts the following types
of input:

*Email* - Capability to add regular emails allows to send personal email
addresses e.g. joe@my_email.com

*Group* - Capabilty to send to a group of users in TACTIC e.g.
Supervisor

*Expression* - Capabilty to insert expressions that specifies a user in
TACTIC. All expressions are identified by curly brackets "\{}". e.g.
\{@SOBJECT(sthpw/login)}

*Send a Notification* - This action will send a notification. The action
box will open additional options to insert a subject and message.

Below is an example which uses more expressions for a notification being
sent whenever a task is assigned.

*Project Schema*

All notification configurations can be accessed through *Admin Views ->
Site Admin-> Notifications*

If there is no process specified, then the notification will be
triggered regardless of process. e.g. during a snapshot or a checkin
