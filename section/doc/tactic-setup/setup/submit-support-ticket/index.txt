Submitting a Support Ticket
---------------------------

To submit an official support ticket to the Southpaw Support Team you
will need a *TACTIC Ticketing Account*. Ticketing accounts are typically
setup for users by Southpaw as part of official TACTIC support. Contact
your TACTIC representative for more information.

You may also visit the Southpaw Technology Support site at:
