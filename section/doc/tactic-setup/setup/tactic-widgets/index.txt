TACTIC Widgets
--------------

A TACTIC Widget is a mini web program which serves a specific purpose
and can be reused. This is what the TACTIC interface is composed of.
Each interface view is presented to a user or a group of users in a
combination of widgets which can accomplish many things:

* Displaying data
* Modifying data
* Displaying images
* Executing processes
* Loading files
* Saving files
* ...and much more

Each of the widgets is a "snippet" of web code (HTML) which TACTIC
builds dynamically on the server and delivers to the user as a web page;
but the TACTIC interface is much more than a web page. TACTIC takes full
advantage of the newest web technology to deliver a flexible and robust
web application.

This widget architecture allows TACTIC to provide a toolbox of useful
widgets which can be combined to build an interface which can adapt
TACTIC to an work flow. Furthermore, due to the openness of TACTIC, it
is easy for developers to create new widgets and share them.

Within this documentation, the same philosophy will be followed. There
is a section which explains the usage of each widget but the main core
of the documentation explains how to use them in combination or with
existing interfaces to work with TACTIC.

A few examples of the common TACTIC widgets are:

* ThumbWdg - A thumbnail viewing widget used in a table, usually with a
title *preview*.
* TableLayoutWdg - Majority of the TACTIC interface is delivered through
a Table widget. It enables the assembly of different type to save as a
new view.
* GanttWdg - A calendar widget which allows viewing and manipulation of
dates.
