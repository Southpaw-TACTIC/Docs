Download Plugins

A TACTIC plugin is a bundle of files that can be installed to enhance
TACTIC’s core functionality. Virtually any TACTIC functionality can be
encapsulated in a plugin. A TACTIC plugin is composed of a number of
possible elements:

* manifest.xml: a file describing the contents in the database that
belong to the plugin and also some metadata about the plugin
* media files (images)
* html, javascript, css files

The Community Site is a central resource to search for plugins. You can
find existing plugins to download and use from the plugins section. You
can download the .zip file from the information section found to the
right of each plugin page. You can also find older versions or previous
releases from the downloads tab of each plugin page.

There are many other things you can do at the plugins community site.
Before you download a plugin, you can go and check the ratings of the
plugin to find out how other users have liked it. You can find
documentation to get information about the plugin or help in installing
the plugin. After you've used the plugin, you can also go rate the
plugin. It might also be helpful if you write a review for the plugin.
This can give other users feedback to know how useful the plugin is.

Plugins don't have to be manually downloaded by you to install them.
TACTIC has built-in functionality that automatically downloads and
installs plugins if you have provided the url to the plugin .zip file.
For more info on this and how to install the plugin using this method,
look at the next "Install and Activate" section.
