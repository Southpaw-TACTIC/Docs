Project Schema
--------------

The project schema is used to create structure or a "data model" of a
project. The Schema view defines the type of items managed by using a
visual graphical node editor. The Schema Editor displays the layout of
the created sTypes and the connections between them.

The Project Schema Editor is available through the Getting Started link
in the side bar which is available after creating a project, or under
the Admin Views under Project Admin -> Project Schema in the side bar.

The Project Schema editor is an essential tool used for the creation of
new project templates. This editor is used to layout the various types
of objects (files, assets) that will be managed and produced on a
project. These types (sTypes) are searchable within TACTIC. Node based
layout and work-flow, allows for simple manipulation and creation of
these various sTypes and their relationships to each other.

To create a new Searchable Type (sType) in the schema, add a new node to
the canvas using the [+] button in the editor. It's also possible to
create a new node from an existing node by simply dragging a connection
line from the output handle of the existing node.

Once the type has been created on the canvas, it can be renamed by right
clicking on the node or using a "CTRL-click" on the node.

*Note*

It is important to note that during this initial process, you are
creating a "blueprint" for your project. The next steps are to
*register* the sTypes. Each sType in TACTIC is represented as a table in
the project database, this table is required to go through a
registration process. This process will generate the table as well as
provide the opportunity to add columns (properties), a pipeline, default
views for the sidebar and more.

*Workflow (Pipelines)*

Where applicable, you can add the pipeline attribute to a search type to
allow for association of the sObjects to a particular pipeline. Having a
pipeline assigned allows an sObject to travel through a set number of
processes. For each of these processes, a task can be created and
assigned to a user, files can be checked in, notes can be submitted and
work hours can be logged.

By choosing "Has Pipeline" on creation, an extra "pipeline_code"
property will be added to store pipeline associations and a Pipeline
will be created and registered for the new sType.

*Note*

To edit the pipeline, you can click the pipeline link in the top of the
editor or, in the sidebar navigate to Project Admin -> Project Workflow.

*Node Options*

Once registered, each node provides options for further configuration of
sType related project setup and configuration, which can be executed
through the main shelf buttons or by right-clicking on a node:
