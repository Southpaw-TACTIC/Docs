[width="100%",cols="29%,71%",]
|=======================================================================
|*script_path* |Specify a script to control what UI it draws or what
happens when the user click on the preview icon. Refer to it by this
script path.

|*detail_class_name* |Specify the default behavior to open up a pop-up
window but just with a different widget written in Python.

|*icon_context* |The context that the widget displays

|*icon_size* |Control the icon size by percentage (up to 100%) e.g. 30%

|*min_icon_size* |Minimum icon size (in pixels).

|*latest_icon* |If set to 'true', the icon displayed corresponds to the
latest checkin in the checkin history. It will disregard the icon
context designated for this search type.

|*filename* |If set to 'true', the file name of the linked file is
displayed under the icon.

|*original* |If set to 'true', the link will point to the original file
with the 'main' file type checked in. Otherwise the scaled down 'web'
version of the file will be linked. This is only applicable to
image-type files where an icon has been generated during a check-in.

|*file_type* |Whether to display the file type for download or not.

|*detail* |If set to 'false', clicking of the thumbnail will link the
underlying picture instead of displaying the single asset view in a
pop-up

|*protocol* |'http'(default) or 'file'. The protocol under which the
thumbnail link will open when being clicked on. When 'file' is set, the
default application is usually Windows explorer or at times Internet
Explorer. 'file' mode can alleviate the bandwidth usage on the web
server when viewing large media files like Quick Time.

|*redirect_expr* |Works similarly as the redirect but in the form of
expression. e.g. @SOBJECT(prod/sequence). If this display option is set
for the ThumbWdg for prod/shot, it will display the icon of its sequence
instead.
