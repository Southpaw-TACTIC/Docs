Client API Structure
--------------------

*Directory Structure*

The client API files are located in the directory
<tactic_install_dir>/src/client. This directory contains all the files
need for the client API. Typically you would copy all of the files in
this directory to a location visible to the client machine.

There are a number of directories in this Client API directory:

* bin: contains useful supported scripts.
* test: contains unit tests for the client API.
* examples: contains a number of small examples to be used for
reference.
* tactic_client_lib: the main directory for the Client API.

The main directory "tactic_client_lib" is the base module that you will
use to access all of the TACTIC client APIs. Typically, you would import
this module when working with the client API:

----------------------------------------------
from tactic_client_lib import TacticServerStub
----------------------------------------------

There are a number of subdirectories under tactic_client_lib:

* *tactic_server_stub.py*: contains the main server class
"TacticServerStub". This class encapsulates all interactions to the
TACTIC server and is generally the primary class used with the client
API.
* *(ALPHA) application*: contains all the classes that deal with
interaction with third-party applications. It provides an abstraction
layer for applications and allows you to set data that can be used by
TACTIC's introspection (verification).
* *common*: contains a number of convenience functions that are commonly
used.
* *interpreter*: contains the client-side pipeline interpreter. This
interpreter executes pipelines defined on the TACTIC server. These
pipelines can be used to create highly complex modular client-side
processes. Typical uses are for the checkin and checkout pipelines.
* *test*: contains a number of test classes used by the unit tests.

You should point to the Client API by having the directory
src/client/tactic_client_lib stored somewhere accessible to client
machines. Import the Tactic_Server_Stub with the following line in your
script from tactic_client_lib:

--------------------------
import Tactic_Server_Stub 
--------------------------

*tactic_server_stub.py*

This module contains the TacticServerStub class, which encapsulates all
interactions with the TACTIC server. This class lets you make full use
of the TACTIC architecture in your custom applications. Although the
TacticServerStub can be instantiated, it is often preferable to use it
as a singleton so you can set up the server once and make use of it from
various locations in your applications:

----------------------------------------------
from tactic_client_lib import TacticServerStub
server = TacticServerStub.get()
----------------------------------------------

Once you have a reference to the TacticServerStub, you must set it up
using three essential parameters: server, ticket, project. These
parameters are described in more detail in the client API setup
documentation.

*Interpreter*

This directory contains all the code needed to execute pipelines on the
client. Pipelines in TACTIC are arbitrary process flow graphs. These
pipelines have a number of advantages over other methods:

* They promote reusability, with each process handler having a
consistent interface from which it can extract information. Typically,
handlers are like mini programs which for the most part are
compartmentalized and have little to do with each other.
* They can be visualized. Using the pipeline editor, the entire flow of
the pipeline can be graphically visualized
* They can be specialized. Each aspect of the pipeline can be written by
those team members most suited for the task.
* They lower the bar to creating complex pipelines. With a large library
of well-written handlers, it becomes possible for non-developers to
create pipelines by graphically piecing processes together.

*Application*

This directory handles all of TACTIC's interaction with third-party
applications.
