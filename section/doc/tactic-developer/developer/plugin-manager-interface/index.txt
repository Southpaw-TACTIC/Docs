*Plugin Manager*

The plugin Manager View is where you will be managing all your plugins.
From this view, you can create a plugin, fully install a plugin, and
modify existing plugins. You can find all your installed plugins in the
plugin list at the left hand side of the view. This shows all the

have come with your TACTIC installation. After selecting a plugin, you
