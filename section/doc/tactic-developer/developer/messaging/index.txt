Messaging

The Subscription Bar Widget allows user to subscribe to an sObject. This
widget provides a convenient way to track any actions or behaviors on an
sObject, including actions from different users. All the messages will
be recorded into Subscription Bar Widget and Message History.

Specify (or look up) the name of the _Inject Subscription Action_ under
*Admin Views -> Project -> Custom Layout Editor->Gear Menu*.

In the example below, in order to activate the _Subscription Bar_, a
sample script has been created and named *Test_Messaging*:

Look up and edit that Test_Messaging script in the custom layout editor.
Use the following HTML code as an example of what to add to the sample
script:

<div class="Test_Messaging">
  <element>
    <display class="tactic.ui.app.SubscriptionBarWdg">
  </display>
  </element>
</div>
------------------------------------------------------

After running the test button, a Test Custom layout window will appear:

Once the subscription bar has been set up, users can select the sObject
they want to subscribe by right clicking the sObject and choosing the
option *Subscribe to Item*:

Now a simple subscription bar has been set up and targeted to selected
sObject. Any actions, such as checking in files, editing description and
changing status, from other users will be recorded.

A detailed subscription history could be viewed in *Message History*.
This tab can be found by clicking the *Subscription History* icon in
every message:

Each entry contains all the detailed information of the message, such as
'Code', 'Category' and 'Login'.
