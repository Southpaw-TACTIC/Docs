Delivering To Related sObjects
------------------------------

TACTIC's digital asset management features now include the ability to
deliver checkins to another process. This provides additional
flexibility for what happens to an asset once it has gone through a
certain process. This feature is currently only configurable by editing
a pipeline's XML definition. A 'to_expression' attribute has been added
to allow this.

In the example below, a pipeline which has the single process
'animation' is set up to deliver to any sObject of the sType
'game/asset'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<pipeline>
  <process name="Animation" task_pipeline="game/Animation"/>
  <connect from="Animation" to="output" to_expression="@SOBJECT(game/asset)])"/>
</pipeline>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The result of this is that any sObjects of sType 'game/asset' will now
show as an option to 'deliver to' in the check-in widget UI. In this
example, an asset called 'test' is being delivered to, this delivery
being the final output of the animation process.

Similar to delivering files, a 'from_expression' can also be used in a
process to allow the process to get files from another process. This
allows use of the 'received' tab in the check-in widget.
