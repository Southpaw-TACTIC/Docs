Views Quickstart
----------------

*Loading Views*

To get started with view, first load a view from the sidebar in your
project. Ideally you will have a view with some items available.

If the view is a Table based view (which is the most common), you will
notice that there is an arrangement of columns with tools and data.

*Inserting and Editing Items*
