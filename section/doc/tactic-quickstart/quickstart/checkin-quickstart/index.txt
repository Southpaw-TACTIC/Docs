Check-in Quick Start
--------------------

The simplest form of a check-in within TACTIC is to check-in a preview
image for an item.

1.  Locate an item you wish to check-in a preview for.

*Note*

If the preview column is not included in your view, you can add it
through the Column Manager.

2.  Right-Click on the item and in the context menu choose "Change
Preview Image"

3.  This will load a file browser where you can choose a preview image
to check-in. Once the file has been uploaded, the preview thumbnail will
automatically update.

4.  To view where the files were placed, expand the *History* column.

*Note*

If the History column is not in the view, it can be added with the
Column Manager, or the view can be changed to "Check-in" from the layout
menu.

5.  Look for your *"icon"* check-in. This is the snapshot entry where
you will see the check-in information (version, login, process,
timestamp etc)
6.  You can expand the "Files" column to see the location of the files
in the central repository.
