What are Tasks?
---------------

The TACTIC Tasks feature allows for the creation and management of
Tasks. Each task in TACTIC include various properties that define and
manage the work-flow of a user. Various markers such as; "Assigned",
"Supervisor", " Bid start date", "Bid end date", and task "Status"
enable all designated users real time information on the progress of a
particular task. These tasks can be created aribtrarilry or on
individual assets or files. Tasks are often driven by a pipeline process
that a partiular item will move through during it's life cycle.

Other details about tasks:

* Tasks can be assigned to any type of item in a project.
* Tasks can be grouped into milestones. The milestone column is used to
categorize benchmark dates for a project.
* Tasks can be assigned to particular users. When a task is assigned to
a user, it appears in their My Tasks View.

* Tasks can be associated to a specific time-line. The "Bid start date"
and the "Bid end date" column displays when the user is scheduled to
work on a task, and when it is scheduled to be complete.
* Bid duration (hours) can also be specified for tracking the alloted
hours for a given task. These can later be compared to work hours for
efficiency and cost analysis and reporting.

*Managing Tasks with a Pipeline*

A typical project will have assets that need to be tracked throughout
the entire course of the project. If each of those assets goes through a
pipeline with a various number of processes, the Tasks list can become
vast quickly, therefore it's important to filter views based on the
needs of the user.

Example scenarios could include:

* A director wants a view that shows all items with a task status that
is set to "review."
* A user wants to view only "character" items with task status set to
"assigned."
* A producer wants to view all items with task status set to "approved."
* A coordinator wants to see all tasks that are due in the current week.

*The Default TACTIC Task Status Pipeline*

The default TACTIC task pipeline includes the following status'. Please
note that these defaults are easily configurable to suit the needs of
the project:

* *Pending:* The task is waiting for a user to start working on it.
* *Ready:* The task status has been set to ready by the supervisor or
administrator.
* *In Progress:* The task is in progress or being worked on.
* *Waiting:* The user is waiting on some event before he or she can
continue working on the task.
* *Review:* The supervisor is reviewing the task.
* *Approved:* The task is approved and complete.
* *Review:*The supervisor has been notified to review a task.
