What are Views?
---------------

Views in TACTIC are the main widgets used to display the items in a
project. The display of these items vary depending on the view. Views
are typically accessed through the sidebar. TACTIC tools and widgets
such as tables, dashboards, edit panels and custom HTML interfaces,
allow the end user to interact and alter the viewing experience.

TACTIC Views are extremely customizable and can be configured to meet
the specific needs and workflow of the end user. Views also provide
quick navigational options such as Search and Grouping, which can be
embedded in various layout styles within a panel interface such as a
Dashboard.
