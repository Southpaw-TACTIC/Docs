Search Quick start
------------------

TACTIC provides two main search tools; the Simple Search and the Search
Box.

*Simple Search*

The Simple Search provides a view specific filters. To use the simple
search:

1.  Load a view of items in your project. In this example a Keywords
field is provided and an Asset Category drop-down narrows down the
search even further.
2.  Fill in the desired search and click the search button.

3.  The results view will automatically refresh once the search is
complete.

*Search Box*

The Search Box can be used to conduct more complex searching in TACTIC.
To test a few examples, load a view of items in a project which have
Tasks. In this example the view is an Asset view.
