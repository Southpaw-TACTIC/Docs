Notes are the ideal communication tool to use to store the message
thread that occurs between content creators, supervisors, clients, etc.

TACTIC Notes are used to add and track comments on an item. A history of
the previous notes are tracked with the item and can be viewed in the
notes history. Each note contains the process for the item, the
timestamp, who added the note and any file attachments. Optionally, each
note can also be sent as an email and can be automated with rules to
send to the correct user groups. Notes can be associated to a pipleine
process with Tasks and Check-ins (Snapshots). Using this association,
the communication of the progress of each individual can be accurately
tracked and retrieved by a supervisor at any time for a production to
the smallest detail.
